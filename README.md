Lab Partner: Leonard Dul
The labs in this course built upon one another. There are the same files used from previous labs, but the code is needed for everything to work. In this course we worked with Quartus and ModelSim to write and test the code. The labs throughout this course taught us how to build a simple pipelined ARM microprocessor.
